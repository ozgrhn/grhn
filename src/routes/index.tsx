          I believe in learning by doing and coding is my favorite way to create
          and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal? To become a well-known developer who builds useful,
          meaningful projects that make people's lives easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, I'm focused on improving my React and backend skills, and
          turning my ideas into real-world apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that great software is not just about code it's about
          understanding people and solving problems.
